The current code can be found <a href=\"http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py\">here</a>.</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23][\\'episodename\\'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1<br></code></pre>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>What is the \"best\" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = \"something\"</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = \"something\"</code></p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn\\'t raise the season_not_found exception)</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>Currently it\\'s using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code></p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it\\'s self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>The problem now is it\\'s presenting itself as a dict, but doesn\\'t have all the functionality, and because I\\'m overriding the <em>_getitem_</em> and <em>_setitem_</em> functions, it\\'s easy to accidently recursively call <em>_getitem_</em> (so I\\'m not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no][\\'attribute\\'] = \\'something\\'</code>). See _setItem and _setData. It\\'s not too bad, since it\\'s currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it\\'s hardly.. elegant..</p>\\r\\\\n\\r\\\\n<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the ShowContainer/etc classes with Dict cause problems?</p>'),\n",

       "  \"<p>I've been really enjoying Python programming lately. I come from a background of a strong love for C-based coding, where everything is perhaps more complicated than it should be (but puts hair on your chest, at least). So switching from C to Python for more complex things that don't require tons of speed has been more of a boon than a bane in writing projects.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>However, coming from this land of brackets and parentheses and structs as far as the naked eye can see, I come across a small problem: I find Python difficult to read.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>For example, the following block of text is hard for me to decipher unless I stare at it (which I dislike doing):</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>if foo:\\\\n   bar = baz\\\\n   while bar not biz:\\\\n      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()\\\\n\\\\ndid_i_not_warn_you_biz()\\\\nmy_father_is_avenged()\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The problem occurs at the end of that if block: all the tabbing and then suddenly returning to a jarring block feels almost disturbing. As a solution, I've started coding my Python like this:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>if foo:\\\\n   bar = baz\\\\n   while bar not biz:\\\\n      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()\\\\n   #-- while --\\\\n#-- if --\\\\n\\\\ndid_i_not_warn_you_biz()\\\\nmy_father_is_avenged()\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>And this, for some odd reason, makes me more able to read my own code. But I'm curious: has anyone else with my strange problem found easier ways to make their tabbed-out code more readable? I'd love to find out if there's a better way to do this before this becomes a huge habit for me.</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

Here\\'s the code that is being tested:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>def current_window_controller(self):\\\\n    try:\\\\n        # iter_window_controllers() iterates in z-order starting\\\\n        # with the controller of the top-most window\\\\n        # assumption: the top-most window is the \"current\" one\\\\n        wc = self.iter_window_controllers().next()\\\\n    except StopIteration:\\\\n        return None\\\\n    return wc\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>One of the things I\\'ve noticed with using mocker is that it\\'s easier to write the application code first and then go back and write the tests second, since most of the time I\\'m mocking many method calls and the syntax to write the mocked calls is much more verbose (thus harder to write) than the application code. It\\'s easier to write the app code and then model the test code off of that.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I find that with this testing method (and a bit of discipline) I can easily write code with 100% test coverage.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I\\'m wondering if these tests are good tests? Will I regret doing it this way down the road when I finally discover the secret to writing good tests?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Am I violating the core principles of TDD so much that my testing is in vain?</p>\\\\n'),\n",

This has been argued as the safer path with less risk than the next option, albeit it might take slightly longer.</li>\\\\n<li>Completely rewrite the application using some other technology, right now the leader of the pack is Python WSGI with a custom framework, ORM, and a good templating solution. There is wiggle room here for even django and other pre-built solutions. This method would hopefully be the quickest solution, as we would probably run a beta beside the actual product, but it does have the potential for a big waste of time if we can't/don't get it right.</li>\\\\n</ol>\\\\n\\\\n<p>This does not mean that our logic is gone, as what we have built over the years is fairly stable, as noted just difficult to deal with. It is built on SQL Server 2005 with heavy use of stored procedures and published on IIS 6, just for a little more background.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Now, the question. Has anyone taken either of the two paths above? If so, was it successful, how could it have been better, etc. We aren't looking to deviate much from doing one of those two things, but some suggestions or other solutions would potentially be helpful.</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

It goes through the Scroll object, which transforms the tool's snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position, here's the code:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>#in Tool\\\\ndef render(self, screen):\\\\n    Scroll.render(screen, self.image, self.snappedPos)\\\\n\\\\n#in Scroll\\\\ndef render(self, screen, image, odePos):\\\\n    pixelPos = self.odePosToPixelPos(odePos)\\\\n    screen.blit(image, pixelPos) # screen is a surface from pygame for the curious\\\\n\\\\ndef odePosToPixelPos(self.odePos):\\\\n    offsetPos = odePos + self.viewPortOffset\\\\n    return odeToPixels(offsetPos)\\\\n\\\\ndef odeToPixels(odeUnits):\\\\n    return int(odeUnits * pixels_in_an_ode_unit)\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Whew, that was a long explanation.  Hope you're still with me... </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The problem I'm now getting is that when I scroll up the drawn image loses alignment with the cursor.<br />\\\\nIt starts snapping to the Y step exactly 1 step below the cursor.\\\\nAdditionally it appears to phase in and out of allignment.<br />\\\\nAt some scrolls it is out by 1 and other scrolls it is spot on.<br />\\\\nIt's never out by more than 1 and it's always snapping to a valid grid location.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Best guess I can come up with is that somewhere I'm truncating some data in the wrong spot, but no idea where or how it ends up with this behavior.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Anyone familiar with coordinate spaces, scrolling and snapping?</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

First, will I get a smaller memory footprint using the Set type (over the dictionary type) for this, or should I use a sorted list where I check every time I insert into the list to see if the ID exists, or is there a third solution that I haven\\'t thought of?

Unfortunately I don\\'t know if that will happen at this time. </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Right now I am looking into storing this data in a structure that is not based on a hash-table (ie. a dictionary).

Part of the server's functionality involves selecting a small subset of rows from a potentially very large table. The exact choice of what rows are selected will need some tuning, and it's important that it's possible for the person running the cluster (eg, myself) to update the selection criteria without getting each and every server administrator to deploy a new version of the server.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Simply writing the function in Python isn't really an option, since nobody is going to want to install a server that downloads and executes arbitrary Python code at runtime.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>What I need are suggestions on the simplest way to implement a Domain Specific Language to achieve this goal. The language needs to be capable of simple expression evaluation, as well as querying table indexes and iterating through the returned rows. Ease of writing and reading the language is secondary to ease of implementing it. I'd also prefer not to have to write an entire query optimiser, so something that explicitly specifies what indexes to query would be ideal.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The interface that this will have to compile against will be similar in capabilities to what the App Engine datastore exports: You can query for sequential ranges on any index on the table (eg, less-than, greater-than, range and equality queries), then filter the returned row by any boolean expression.

Some of these API calls allow us to load various kinds of file, and the loading code is implemented in C. File loading happens in a separate thread, and calls back into Python when the data is available. So far, all well and dandy.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>We've been i14ing (heh) our product, and one thing we'd like to do is format user-facing numerical output according to the user's locale settings. So, from Python, we do this:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>import locale\\\\nlocale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Now, this works (in that the user-facing numbers are formatted correctly for their locale). However, if the user's locale differs from the default C locale, any files that are subsequently loaded will return incorrect data, presumably because all string-to-float conversion has been affected, right down to the metal.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>We can't work around this by implementing locale aware file loading, so our current workaround is to only set the locale when formatting output for the user, and then set it back again afterwards.

So suppose <strong>Persons/views.py</strong> has something likeso:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>def detail(request, person_id):\\\\n   person = get_object_or_404( Person, pk=person_id )\\\\n   return render_to_response(\\'persons/details.html\\',\\\\n      { \\'title\\' : unicode(person), \\'addresses\\': person.address_set.all() } )\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>And, I have a template, <strong>persons/details.html</strong>, with code, for example, like-so:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>{% extends \"base.html\" %}\\\\n\\\\n{% for address in addresses %}\\\\n&lt;b&gt;{{ address.name }}&lt;/b&gt;\\\\n  {{ address.type }} &lt;br&gt;\\\\n  {{ address.street_1 }}&lt;br&gt;\\\\n  {{ address.street_2 }}&lt;br&gt;\\\\n  {{ address.city }} {{ address.stateprov }} {{ address.postalcode }}&lt;br&gt;\\\\n  {{ address.country }}\\\\n  &lt;hr&gt;\\\\n{{ endfor }}\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I am repeating this code quite a bit, often with minor variations, such when it\\'s in a table, and then &lt; br > must be substituted by &lt; /td >&lt; td >. Other times, I don\\'t want a street_2 to display (or the &lt; br > after it). All to say, there is fundamental logic that I want to express, that I am even more loath to tote around with block-and-copy!</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>What I want is a <strong>persons/details.html</strong> with, for example, the following: </p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>{% extends \"base.html\" %}\\\\n{% for address in addresses %} \\\\n  {% address.as_html4 %}\\\\n{% endfor %}\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>And if I want inline table, something likeso (I guess!):</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>{% extends \"base.html\" %}\\\\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\\\\n{% for address in addresses %}\\\\n  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; {% address.as_html4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; %} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\\\\n{% endfor %}\\\\n&lt;/table&gt;\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The question is, then: Where is the best place to put the formatting? The logic?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Django seem to have the following (plausible) options:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<ol>\\\\n<li><p>Put the formatting in models.py</p></li>\\\\n<li><p>Put the logic/formatting in views.py</p></li>\\\\n<li><p>Put the logic/formatting in some other sub-class of Person or Address (i.e.  addresses/html4.py)</p></li>\\\\n<li><p>Create custom tags</p></li>\\\\n</ol>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Help / insight much appreciated!</p>\\\\n'),\n",

The signature will still not be shown properly in automatically generated documentation. It\\'s easy to update the function and forget about changing the docstring, or to make a typo. [<i>And yes, I\\'m aware of the fact that the docstring already duplicates the function body. Please ignore this; funny_function is just a random example.</i>]</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>2 -- Not use a decorator, or use a special-purpose decorator for every specific signature:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>def funny_functions_decorator(f):\\\\n    def g(x, y, z=3):\\\\n        return f(int(x), int(y), z=int(z))\\\\n    g.__name__ = f.__name__\\\\n    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__\\\\n    return g\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>This works fine for a set of functions that have identical signature, but it\\'s useless in general. As I said in the beginning, I want to be able to use decorators entirely generically.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I\\'m looking for a solution that is fully general, and automatic.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>So the question is: is there a way to edit the decorated function signature after it has been created?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Otherwise, can I write a decorator that extracts the function signature and uses that information instead of \"*kwargs, **kwargs\" when constructing the decorated function?

The team itself has doubled in size from 2 to 4 over the past few weeks and we expect continued growth for the next couple of months at least.  One issue that has started to plague us is getting everyone up to speed in terms of getting their development environment configured and having all the right eggs installed, etc.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I'm looking for ways to simplify this process and make it less error prone.  Both zc.buildout and virtualenv look like they would be good tools for addressing this problem but both seem to concentrate primarily on the python-specific issues.  We have a couple of small subprojects in other languages (Java and Ruby specifically) as well as numerous python extensions that have to be compiled natively (lxml, MySQL drivers, etc).  In fact, one of the biggest thorns in our side has been getting some of these extensions compiled against appropriate versions of the shared libraries so as to avoid segfaults, malloc errors and all sorts of similar issues.  It doesn't help that out of 4 people we have 4 different development environments -- 1 leopard on ppc, 1 leopard on intel, 1 ubuntu and 1 windows.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Ultimately what would be ideal would be something that works roughly like this, from the dos/unix prompt:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>$ git clone [repository url]\\\\n...\\\\n$ python setup-env.py\\\\n...</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>that then does what zc.buildout/virtualenv does (copy/symlink the python interpreter, provide a clean space to install eggs) then installs all required eggs, including installing any native shared library dependencies, installs the ruby project, the java project, etc.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Obviously this would be useful for both getting development environments up as well as deploying on staging/production servers.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Ideally I would like for the tool that accomplishes this to be written in/extensible via python, since that is (and always will be) the lingua franca of our team, but I am open to solutions in other languages.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>So, my question then is: does anyone have any suggestions for better alternatives or any experiences they can share using one of these solutions to handle larger/broader install bases?</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

       "  \"<p>I've been wondering about how hard it would be to write some Python code to search a string for the index of a substring of the form <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code>, for example, where <em>expr</em> is meant to be a Python expression or something resembling one.  Given such a thing, one could easily imagine going on to check the expression's syntax with <code>compile()</code>, evaluate it against a particular scope with <code>eval()</code>, and perhaps even substitute the result into the original string.  People must do very similar things all the time.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I could imagine solving such a problem using a third-party parser generator [oof], or by hand-coding some sort of state machine [eek], or perhaps by convincing Python's own parser to do the heavy lifting somehow [hmm].  Maybe there's a third-party templating library somewhere that can be made to do exactly this.  Maybe restricting the syntax of <em>expr</em> is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example, maybe all I really need is something that matches any <em>expr</em> that has balanced curly braces.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>What's your sense?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<h2>Update:</h2>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Thanks very much for your responses so far!  Looking back at what I wrote yesterday, I'm not sure I was sufficiently clear about what I'm asking.  Template substitution is indeed an interesting problem, and probably much more useful to many more people than the expression extraction subproblem I'm wondering about, but I brought it up only as a simple example of how the answer to my question might be useful in real life.  Some other potential applications might include passing the extracted expressions to a syntax highlighter; passing the result to a real Python parser and looking at or monkeying with the parse tree; or using the sequence of extracted expressions to build up a larger Python program, perhaps in conjunction with some information taken from the surrounding text.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code> syntax I mentioned is also intended as an example, and in fact I wonder if I shouldn't have used <code>$(</code><em>expr</em><code>)</code> as my example instead, because it makes the potential drawbacks of the obvious approach, along the lines of <code>re.finditer(r'$\\\\{([^}]+)\\\\}', s)</code>, a bit easier to see.  Python expressions can (and often do) contain the <code>)</code> (or <code>}</code>) character.  It seems possible that handling any of those cases might be much more trouble than it's worth, but I'm not convinced of that yet.  Please feel free to try to make this case!</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Prior to posting this question, I spent quite a bit of time looking at Python template engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low-level functionality I'm asking about -- namely, something that can find expressions in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expressions embedded using a single hard-coded syntax, always evaluating them, and always substituting the results back into the original string.  I haven't figured out how to use any of them to solve my problem yet, but I do very much appreciate the suggestions regarding more to look at (can't believe I missed that wonderful list on the wiki!).  The API documentation for these things tends to be pretty high-level, and I'm not too familiar with the internals of any of them, so I'm sure I could use help looking at those and figuring out how to get them to do this sort of thing.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Thanks for your patience!</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

I found a really good library, doing exactly what\\'s needed, but it is written in Python. I decided to experiment with embedding Python code in C++, using the Boost.Python library.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The C++ code looks something like this:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>#include &lt;string&gt;\\\\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\\\\n#include &lt;boost/python.hpp&gt;\\\\n\\\\nusing namespace boost::python;\\\\n\\\\nint main(int, char **) \\\\n{\\\\n    Py_Initialize();\\\\n\\\\n    try \\\\n    {\\\\n    \\tobject module((handle&lt;&gt;(borrowed(PyImport_AddModule(\"__main__\")))));\\\\n\\\\n    \\tobject name_space = module.attr(\"__dict__\");\\\\n    \\tobject ignored = exec(\"from myModule import MyFunc\\\\n\"\\\\n    \\t\\t              \"MyFunc(\\\\\"some_arg\\\\\")\\\\n\",\\\\n    \\t\\t              name_space);\\\\n\\\\n    \\tstd::string res = extract&lt;std::string&gt;(name_space[\"result\"]);\\\\n    } \\\\n    catch (error_already_set) \\\\n    {\\\\n    \\tPyErr_Print();\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    Py_Finalize();\\\\n    return 0;\\\\n}\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>A (very) simplified version of the Python code looks like this:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>import thirdparty\\\\n\\\\ndef MyFunc(some_arg):\\\\n    result = thirdparty.go()\\\\n    print result\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Now the problem is this: \\\\n\\'MyFunc\\' executes fine, i can see the print of \\'result\\'.\\\\nWhat i cannot do is read \\'result\\' back from the C++ code. The extract command never finds \\'result\\' in any namespace.\\\\nI tried defining \\'result\\' as a global, i even tried returning a tuple, but i cannot get it to work.</p>\\\\n'),\n",

       "  \"<p>I am working on a desktop application in PyGTK and seem to be bumping up against some limitations of my file organization.  Thus far I've structured my project this way:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<ul>\\\\n<li>application.py - holds the primary application class (most functional routines)</li>\\\\n<li>gui.py - holds a loosely coupled GTK gui implementation.  Handles signal callbacks, etc.</li>\\\\n<li>command.py - holds command line automation functions not dependent on data in the application class</li>\\\\n<li>state.py - holds the state data persistence class</li>\\\\n</ul>\\\\n\\\\n<p>This has served fairly well so far, but at this point application.py is starting to get rather long.  I have looked at numerous other PyGTK applications and they seem to have similar structural issues.  At a certain point the primary module starts to get very long and there is not obvious way of breaking the code out into narrower modules without sacrificing clarity and object orientation.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I have considered making the GUI the primary module and having seperate modules for the toolbar routines, the menus routines, etc, but at that point I believe I will lose most of the benefits of OOP and end up with an everything-references-everything scenario.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Should I just deal with having a very long central module or is there a better way of structuring the project so that I don't have to rely on the class browser so much?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><strong>EDIT I</strong></p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Ok, so point taken regarding all the MVC stuff.  I do have a rough approximation of MVC in my code, but admittedly I could probably gain some mileage by further segregating the model and controller.  However, I am reading over python-gtkmvc's documentation (which is a great find by the way, thank you for referencing it) and my impression is that its not going to solve my problem so much as just formalize it.  My application is a single glade file, generally a single window. So no matter how tightly I define the MVC roles of the modules I'm still going to have one controller module doing most everything, which is pretty much what I have now. Admittedly I'm a little fuzzy on proper MVC implementation and I'm going to keep researching, but it doesn't look to me like this architecture is going to get any more stuff out of my main file, its just going to rename that file to controller.py.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Should I be thinking about separate Controller/View pairs for seperate sections of the window (the toolbar, the menus, etc)? Perhaps that is what I'm missing here.  It seems that this is what S. Lott is referring to in his second bullet point.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Thanks for the responses so far.</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

The original authors have moved to this project as well. Jenkins is now a standard package on Ubuntu/Debian, RedHat/Fedora/CentOS, and others. The following update is still essentially correct. The starting point to do this with <a href=\"http://jenkins-ci.org\">Jenkins</a> is different.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> After trying a few alternatives, I think I\\'ll stick with Hudson. <a href=\"http://integrityapp.com/\">Integrity</a> was nice and simple, but quite limited. I think <a href=\"http://buildbot.net/trac\">Buildbot</a> is better suited to having numerous build-slaves, rather than everything running on a single machine like I was using it.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Setting Hudson up for a Python project was pretty simple:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<ul>\\\\n<li>Download Hudson from <a href=\"http://hudson-ci.org/\">http://hudson-ci.org/</a></li>\\\\n<li>Run it with <code>java -jar hudson.war</code></li>\\\\n<li>Open the web interface on the default address of <code>http://localhost:8080</code></li>\\\\n<li>Go to Manage Hudson, Plugins, click \"Update\" or similar</li>\\\\n<li>Install the Git plugin (I had to set the <code>git</code> path in the Hudson global preferences)</li>\\\\n<li>Create a new project, enter the repository, SCM polling intervals and so on</li>\\\\n<li>Install <code>nosetests</code> via <code>easy_install</code> if it\\'s not already</li>\\\\n<li>In the a build step, add <code>nosetests --with-xunit --verbose</code></li>\\\\n<li>Check \"Publish JUnit test result report\" and set \"Test report XMLs\" to <code>**/nosetests.xml</code></li>\\\\n</ul>\\\\n\\\\n<p>That\\'s all that\\'s required. You can setup email notifications, and <a href=\"http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugins\">the plugins</a> are worth a look. A few I\\'m currently using for Python projects:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<ul>\\\\n<li><a href=\"http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/SLOCCount+Plugin\">SLOCCount plugin</a> to count lines of code (and graph it!) - you need to install <a href=\"http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/\">sloccount</a> separately</li>\\\\n<li><a href=\"http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Violations\">Violations</a> to parse the PyLint output (you can setup warning thresholds, graph the number of violations over each build)</li>\\\\n<li><a href=\"http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Cobertura+Plugin\">Cobertura</a> can parse the coverage.py output. Nosetest can gather coverage while running your tests, using <code>nosetests --with-coverage</code> (this writes the output to <code>**/coverage.xml</code>)</li>\\\\n</ul>\\\\n'),\n",
